# Decision-Tree-Implementation

Load Data: Uses the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Split Dataset: Divides the data into training and testing sets.

Create Model: Uses DecisionTreeClassifier() with Gini impurity and max_depth=3.

Train Model: Fits the decision tree using training data.

Predict & Evaluate: Makes predictions and calculates accuracy.

Visualize Tree: Uses plot_tree() to display the decision tree.

I'll create a Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation of a Decision Tree model using Scikit-Learn. The notebook will:

✅ Load a dataset (Iris dataset by default, but you can change it).
✅ Preprocess data if needed.

✅ Train and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier.

✅ Visualize the Decision Tree.

✅ Provide insights and analysis.
